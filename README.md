# README

A toolkit for working with Z-modules, lattices, and the related cryptosystems.

You can find an implementation of the GGH public key cryptosystem in GGH.py.

Utilities.py contains various mathematical functions used in the other files

Currently undergoing some restructuring. Expect nice bubble diagrams of classes soon.
