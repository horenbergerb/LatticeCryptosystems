# README

Just a collection of notes and code on lattice cryptosystems.

You can find an implementation of the GGH public key cryptosystem in GGH.py.

You can find notes on lattice cryptosystems in the folder LatticeNotes.
These notes are frequently almost (or exactly) verbatim from "An Introduction to Cryptography" by Hoffstein, Pipher, and Silverman. I distilled the concepts of interest and tried to use my own language. I also added a selection of questions which occurred to me while reading.
